<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a manufacturing engineer who is currently working as a galvanizing production controller, 
  responsible for overseeing the anti-corrosion coating process with zinc (Hot Dip Galvanizing) 
  to produce galvanized products that meet the standards and expectations of customers. 
  
<p>Now i'm learning new things to put my self under pressure to discover new knowledge out of my professional domain.
  Web development program by Dr. Angela on Udemy got my attention. No coding experience needed, affordable prices (for me),
  and has so many rating on Udemy. <br>
  The goal is to utilize web as a tool for presentation, explanation, and sharing data. but to do that i know it's not easy. Now i have to push my self hard to
  work on this, understand every lesson, and passed the test.
